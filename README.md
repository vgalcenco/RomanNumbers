# RomanNumbers

## The Problem

Implement an arabic to roman numbers converter. The following table provides a couple of examples
of the input data and expected output.

| Input   | Output   |
| ------- | -------- |
|  1      |  I       |
|  2      |  II      |
|  3      |  III     |
|  4      |  IV      |
|  5      |  V       |
|  6      |  VI      |
|  7      |  VII     |
|  8      |  VIII    |
|  9      |  IX      |
| 10      |  X       |
| ...     |  ...     |


## Comment
This was a problem I was given in a pair programming exercise and
I liked it for a simple reason, i.e. it highlights the power of TDD.

As you add more and more tests and the implementation evolves through the Red-Green-Refactor cycle,
a few patterns start to evolve. Through refactoring the algorithm is derived and the implementation
becomes cleaner as you cover more and more scenarios.

Enjoy!
